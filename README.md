### Situation:
A large company with over 300,000 employees wanted to offer early retirement packages and do succession planning in the management ranks, refreshing its workforce. 

### Tasks and Actions:
I created ERD diagrams for the DB and SQL code to load the data. I then performed an analysis by creating additional queries for new aggregate tables, filters, sorting, and elimination of bad data - ultimately documenting the results in a report. 

### Results:
Senior Managers and HR recieved report and target lists of employees to offer retirement packages along with a Salary Cost Analysis and a Target Mentors list for refreshed workforce. 

### Process and Technology
- Emphasized Exploration and Analysis sections of process.
- CSV files from HR on employee and department data were provided. 
- PostgreSQL Database, QuickDBD and Visual Studio used for exploration and analysis.


# [Project 2 - PyCitySchool Analysis](https://github.com/tcottrell321/school_district_analysis)

The objective of this module was to take 2 CSV files reflecting test results from 14 different schools in the district. The analysis was conducted under the supervision of a Senior Data Scientist - Maria. Maria provided the interface between the Clients - the School District Board - and our work - to answer the questions relevant to the School Board. 

As in real life, new questions -- and required analysis -- emerged as the original requests were completed. These additional analysis requirements were added to the scope of the project - and full-filled. 

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.6.9 environment
- School Data File in CSV format
- Student Data File in CSV format
- Import Pandas as PD
- Import OS
