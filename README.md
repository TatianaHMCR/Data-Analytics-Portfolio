# Projects Emphasizing Use of Databases, SQL, Excel, and the ETL Process

## [Using Analytics to Rightsize and Refresh Employee Base](https://github.com/tcottrell321/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis)
Using PostgresSQL, QuickDBD, Visual Studio and employee attributes to produce target employee lists for early retirement, succession planning, mentoring roles and salary cost analysis.

### Situation:
A large company with over 300,000 employees needed to rightsize by offering early retirement packages while doing succession planning and mentoring of their refreshed workforce.  

### Actions and Output:
Using provided CSV employee files, I used SQL and Visual Studio - plus a local PostgreSQL database to perform an exploratory data analysis against various parameters. I designed the ERD, created the DB, loaded the data, then filtered, sorted, and cleaned the data. Finally, I built SQL queries to answer the business questions posed by Senior Managment - ultimately providing them a written report to make informed, legal, data-driven rightsizing and succession planning decisions. To promote transparency and legality, I documented each part of the process in the report so Senior Mgt could see how the target employee lists were generated. The report is stored in the GitHub Project Repository. 


# [Project 2 - Kickstarter Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/tcottrell321/kickstarter-analysis)

### Situation:
Our Client, Louise, wants to create a Kickstarter Campaign to fund her new US Based Theatre Play. She estimates she will need to raise $10-12K. In order to ensure success with this campaign, she requested an analysis of past Kickstarter Campaigns to determine if there were any common attributes or trends leading to success.

### Tasks and Actions:
Using data from over 4000 campaigns, the data was filtered, sorted, augmented with calculated columns, and statistically analyzed using EXCEL for any findings that might be useful to Louise.

### Results:
A report was written showing both the statistical results as well as the final recommendations for how best to launch her Kickstarter Campaign. A Statistical Analysis Summary Table was included with Averages, Mean, Std Deviation, and IRQ for both the Goal and Pledged Columns of data. 

### Process and Technology
- CSV flat files were extracted using the Kickstarter API. This project emphasized the Exploration/Metrics and Analysis/Insights blocks of process.
- EXCEL was used particularly the statistical functions and plots such as Whisker Plots, Line Charts, and Tabular Data Charts for Visualization of the Analysis. 


# [Project 3 - PyCitySchool Analysis](https://github.com/tcottrell321/school_district_analysis)
![](/images/Schools.jpg)

### Situation:
Test results from 14 different schools in the district needed to be analyzed showing overall school performance against various parameters such as Spending/Student and Class Sizes. 

### Tasks and Actions: 
The student files were imported into dataframes then the data had to be cleaned for NULL data, inconsistencies in text fields, and omitting data from 9th Grade classes as it had been changed dishonestly at the school level. To do this work, a number of Python functions and methods from Python and the Pandas/Numpy libraries. The data was then analyszed to answer a number of questions from the School Board, as well as provide District Level Summary Analysis. Consideration had to be given as to how the omitted data affected overall Summary Results. Work was performed under the direction of a Senior Data Scientist who worked directly with the School Board. 

### Results: 
The results were summarized into a final report with District Level Summary Tables, insights and conclusions found in the data. 

### Technology Stack
- This project emphasized skills in the Wrangling and Analysis phase using Python and several libraries. 
- Python, Pandas, Numpy 
- School and Student Data Files in CSV format

# [My Tableau Public Visualization Portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/profile/thomas.cottrell#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0)
![](/images/Deficit.JPG)

### Situation:
Visualizations are a powerful way to tell a story with data. As a member of the global Tableau Community via #MakoverMonday I am challenged each Monday to improve a VIZ using either Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio or other visualization tools, and publish my work to the Tableau Public Website. Each Wednesday, the Community of several hundred Data Analysts gets feedback from Leaders in the Community. 

### Tasks and Actions: 
Publish a new visualization each week and obtain feedback from other leaders in the Community to iteratively improve our story telling skills.  

### Results: 
See my visualizations and my improvement over time.  

### Technology Stack
- Primarily Tableau but may include links to Google Data Studio, Power BI or other Visualizations using Python Libraries such as Matplotlib.
