# [Project 1 - Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis](https://github.com/tcottrell321/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis)
![](/images/Employees1.jpg)

### Situation:
A large company with over 300,000 employees wanted to offer early retirement packages and do succession planning in the management ranks, refreshing its workforce. 

### Tasks and Actions:
I created ERD diagrams for the DB and SQL code to load the data. I then performed an analysis by creating additional queries for new aggregate tables, filters, sorting, and elimination of bad data - ultimately documenting the results in a report. 

### Results:
Senior Managers and HR recieved report and target lists of employees to offer retirement packages along with a Salary Cost Analysis and a Target Mentors list for refreshed workforce. 

### Process and Technology
- Emphasized Exploration/Metrics and Analysis/Insights blocks of process.
- CSV files from HR on employee and department data were provided. 
- PostgreSQL Database, QuickDBD and Visual Studio used for exploration and analysis.

# [Project 2 - Kickstarter Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/tcottrell321/kickstarter-analysis)

### Situation:
Our Client, Louise, wants to create a Kickstarter Campaign to fund her new US Based Theatre Play. She estimates she will need to raise $10-12K. In order to ensure success with this campaign, she requested an analysis of past Kickstarter Campaigns to determine if there were any common attributes or trends leading to success.

### Tasks and Actions:
Using data from over 4000 campaigns, the data was filtered, sorted, augmented with calculated columns, and statistically analyzed using EXCEL for any findings that might be useful to Louise.

### Results:
A report was written showing both the statistical results as well as the final recommendations for how best to launch her Kickstarter Campaign. A Statistical Analysis Summary Table was included with Averages, Mean, Std Deviation, and IRQ for both the Goal and Pledged Columns of data. 

### Process and Technology
- CSV flat files were extracted using the Kickstarter API. This project emphasized the Exploration/Metrics and Analysis/Insights blocks of process.
- EXCEL was used particularly the statistical functions and plots such as Whisker Plots, Line Charts, and Tabular Data Charts for Visualization of the Analysis. 


# [Project 3 - PyCitySchool Analysis](https://github.com/tcottrell321/school_district_analysis)

The objective of this module was to take 2 CSV files reflecting test results from 14 different schools in the district. The analysis was conducted under the supervision of a Senior Data Scientist - Maria. Maria provided the interface between the Clients - the School District Board - and our work - to answer the questions relevant to the School Board. 

As in real life, new questions -- and required analysis -- emerged as the original requests were completed. These additional analysis requirements were added to the scope of the project - and full-filled. 

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.6.9 environment
- School Data File in CSV format
- Student Data File in CSV format
- Import Pandas as PD
- Import OS
